1. Open a terminal at your source code root directory
2. Type `packagaya init` and press enter
3. Answer the questions
4. Done!

::: tip
The `init` command will check if the current directory is empty.

If it is empty, a new project from scratch will be created.

Otherwise the command will initialize a new project with the current source files.
